///  Purpose of this file
///  Essentially, we have two approaches **on demand** and **reactive**
/// The **on demand** approach will take three file names, model, template, transforms, and an output-dir 
/// The **reactive** will take a gulp style build script and use it to decide what to do.
/// 
/// Not sure how much code exists here on in the bin directory file.
