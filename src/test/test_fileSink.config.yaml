# Custom code lines are always prefixed and can be optionally suffixed depending on the filetype
# Each file extention can have a prefix and optional suffix separated by double dot (..)
# Therefore, 
#    html: <!--..-->
# means that when FileSync is writing to a file ending in .html, then it will begin each custom code marker with <!--
# and terminate each custom code marker with -->. This means that a syntax parser or browser with treat the marker as a comment.
# If FileSync is writing to a file fred.blah and there is no 'blah' setting in this config file, then it will use
# the default, which in the example below is start the custom code marker with '//' but no terminator.
# This is a common comment marker for most common programming languages at the time of writing.
